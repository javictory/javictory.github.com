## About the site
This is a personal website of Javictory, created with github and jekyll. 
Create your own website is as easy as clone or fork a [template](https://github.com/javictory/javictory.github.com.git) on github. 

### Admin tools
* Jekyll theme templates: [jekyllthemes.org](http://jekyllthemes.org)
   * Theme used: [cool-concise](http://jekyllthemes.org/themes/cool-concise-high-end/)
* Jekyll official site: [jekyllrb.com](http://jekyllrb.com)
* YAML for human readable markdown: [yaml.org](http://www.yaml.org/)
* markdown reference: [kramdown](http://kramdown.gettalong.org/quickref.html)

### About comments
Add a variable called `comments` to the [YAML front matter](http://jekyllrb.com/docs/frontmatter/) and set its value to true. A sample might look like:

    ---
    layout: post
    comments: true
    # other options
    ---
